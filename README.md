Explanation
Half Adder

A Half Adder is a digital circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers.

The Sum is calculated using the XOR (^) operation.

The Carry is generated only when both inputs are 1, which is calculated using the AND (&) operation.

Example:
If a = 1 and b = 1

Sum = 0

Carry = 1
