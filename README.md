# Half-adder
This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a Half Adder and a Full Adder, along with their respective truth tables. These are fundamental building blocks in digital electronics and computer architecture.
📌 Overview

Half Adder
Adds two single-bit binary numbers
Produces:
Sum
Carry

Full Adder
Adds three single-bit binary numbers (including carry-in)
Produces:
Sum
Carry-out
This project demonstrates how logical operations used in hardware can be simulated using Python.
